Porting systemd To New Distributions

        You need to make the follow changes to adapt systemd to your
        distribution:

        0) Make your distribution recognized via the autoconf checks
        in configure.ac. Grep for the word "fedora" (case
        insensitively) and you should be able to find the places where
        you need to add/change things.

        1) Patch src/hostname-setup.c so that systemd knows where to
        read your host name from.

        2) Check the unit files in units/ if they match your
        distribution. Most likely you will have to make additions to
        units/*.m4 and create a copy of units/fedora/ with changes for
        your distribution.

        3) Adjust Makefile.am to register the unit files you added in
        step 2. Also you might need to update the m4 invocation in
        Makefile.am. Grep for the word "fedora" (case insensitively)
        and you should be able to find the places where you need to
        add/change things.

        4) Try it out.

CONTRIBUTING UPSTREAM:

        We are interested in merging your changes upstream, if they
        are for a big, and well-known distribution. Unfortunately we
        don't have the time and resources to maintain
        distribution-specific patches for all distributions on the
        planet, hence please do not send us patches that adds systemd
        support to non-mainstream or niche distributions.

        Thank you for understanding.
